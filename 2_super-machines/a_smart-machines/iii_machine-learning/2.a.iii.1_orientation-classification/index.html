    <h2>Unit 1A: Basic Circuits</h2>
<h3>Objective </h3>

    <p>Learn to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">support vector machine</a> (SVM)for classifying multi-dimensional sensor data, among a group of pre-defined classes of feature vectors. Specificlly, learn to utilize SVM to recognize the orientation of a mobile phone, based on its accelerometer sensors and a series of pre-defined orientations.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <p>Begin by setting up a mobile phone to send accelerometer data to a computer using UDP over a wireless network. </p>
    <ol>

      <li>Click on "clear" to clear the SVM model</li>
      <li>Click on "learn" to enter training mode</li>
      <li>Hold your mobile phone in a particular orientation and click on the first square 10-20 times. Each time you click, a 3-dimensional "feature vector" made up of the x, y and z acceleration values is sent into the SVM as an example of class 1.</li>
      <li>Hold your mobile phone in a different orientation and click on the second square 10-20 times. Each time you click, a 3-dimensional "feature vector" made up of the x, y and z acceleration values is sent into the SVM as an example of class 2.</li>
      <li>Repeate steps 3-4 for several more poses</li>
      <li>Click on "train" to create the SVM model</li>
      <li>Click on "map" to enter mapping mode</li>
      <li>Move your phone among different trained orientations, compare with the the classification results show in the interger box under "ml.svm"</li>
      <li>Turn ON "probs" to see the likelyhood of each class as a continuous variable</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>How else can this technique be used?</li>
      <li>How many orientations can you recognize with this technique?</li>
      <li>How can you help the SVM be more accurate, but adding additional sensor information to the feature vectors?</li>
    </ul>
