    <h2>Unit 1A: Basic Circuits</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Map multi-dimensional data from a mobile phone to parameters for audio synthesis using PureData</p>
    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>

      <li>Set up a mobile phone to send accelerometer data to a computer using UDP over a wireless network. The easiest way is to download one of many free ("Control" for iOS or Android, "andOSC" or "OSChook" for Android, etc.); join CMU-SECURE wireless with your computer and your mobile phone; <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=what's my ip">find the IP address of your computer</a> and set it as the "destination" or "host" in the mobile App; set the destionation "port" to 10000; activate a user interface with accelerometers</li>
      <li>Learn how to receive, unpack and route <a href="http://opensoundcontrol.org/introduction-osc">OpenSoundControl</a> messages in PureData with the "udpreceive", "unpackOSC" and "routeOSC" objects. "Open Sound Control (OSC) is a protocol for communication among computers, sound synthesizers, and other multimedia devices that is optimized for modern networking technology.&#160;"</li>
      <li>Take apart multi-dimensional sensor data and map different elements to different parameters of audio synthesis.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments and Challenges</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Use this scheme to get access to every sensor on your mobile phone, within PureData</li>
      <li>Use PureData to communicate bewteen two cellphones, running two Apps that can send and receive OSC</li>
    </ul>
