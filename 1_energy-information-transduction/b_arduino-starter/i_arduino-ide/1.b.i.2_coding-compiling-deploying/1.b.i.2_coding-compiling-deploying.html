    <h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Running a program on an Arduino.</p>

    <p>The best references for getting started with the Arduino are supplied
    with the IDE: the <b>Help</b> menu includes a section for <b>Getting Started</b> which
    covers operation and <b>Reference</b> which covers the language.</p>

    <p>In addition, the main Arduino site has similar introduction pages:
      <ol>
	<li><a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage">Arduino: Getting Started</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage">Arduino: Reference</a></li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>The <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Foundations">Arduino Tutorial
      Foundations</a> page addresses many basic ideas and syntax.  If you have
      no programming experience at all, please be sure to look at
      <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Sketch">First Sketch</a>,
      <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Variables">Variables</a>, and
      <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/FunctionDeclaration">Functions.</a>
      For more beginner help, please remember that the Arduino language is a subset of C++, so many elementary C or C++ tutorials online can cover the basics of variables, functions, control flow, and program logic, e.g., anything which relates purely to the internal logic of a computation rather than the physical interface.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Connect an Arduino Uno to the host computer with the IDE.</li>

      <li>Configure the IDE for the Uno as per the Getting Started guide.</li>

      <li>Load the Examples/01.Basics/Blink sketch.  The Examples are found on
	the File menu, as is the Sketchbook in which you can put your own
	programs.</li>

      <li>This program uses just the LED onboard the Uno, so no additional
	external circuit is required.</li>

      <li>Verify/Compile the program to check that the program text is valid.</li>
      <li>Upload to the Uno and check that the LED blinks when the program runs.</li>
      <li>Change the numbers in the <code>delay</code> statements; the units are milliseconds.</li>
      <li>Re-upload and observe the change in LED behavior.</li>
      <li>Upload the ReadAnalogVoltage sketch.</li>
      <li>Find and open the Serial Monitor.  Set it to 9600 baud to match the sketch.</li>
      <li>Observe the measurements of analog noise printed to the monitor.
	Attach a wire to A0 and touch it with your finger to change the noise
	input.</li>
      <li>The serial monitor is your primary means for seeing the debugging output
      from your programs; you should become familiar with the Serial library and
      printing out text and numbers.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>It can be quite difficult to debug complex programs when the serial port
      is the only source of information, and especially when it is also being
      used for transmitting data baack to the hosts.  It can be helpful to use
      digital output pins for indicating single bits of program state and
      viewing the voltages on the oscilloscope.  Later, we will use the OSC
      library to multiplex different streams of data over the same serial port,
      which also allows transmitting debugging cues.</p>
