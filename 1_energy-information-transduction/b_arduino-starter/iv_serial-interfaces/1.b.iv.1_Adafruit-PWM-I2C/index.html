    <h2>Exercise: Adafruit PWM I2C Module</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>
 
    <p>Communicate digital data between an Arduino and a PWM module using an I<sup>2</sup>C bus.</p>

    <p>The Arduino I/O pins allow it to bridge the gap directly between digital
      information and physical signals.  However, it can also transmit data to
      and from other computational devices.  The previous examples have
      implicitly used USB and an asynchronous serial UART for downloading
      programs and looking at text output.  But even simpler bus standards, such
      as
      <em>I<sup>2</sup>C</em> and <em>SPI</em> are useful for connecting an
      Arduino to I/O modules or even other Arduinos.</p>

    <p>This capability is useful for rapid prototyping, since many interface
      functions are available in modular form.  For example, there exist modules:</p>
      <ol>
	<li>to extend the number of available digital inputs or outputs</li>

	<li>with specialized electrical behavior such as automatic current
	  regulation or PWM generation</li>

	<li>which can provide RGB color LED illumination controlled purely by
	  digital data, including PWM generation and power drive</li>
      </ol>

    <p>Using digital busses essentially makes the Arduino a node in a network
      comprising multiple computers, possibly including a host desktop or
      laptop.  Each type of link has different characteristics:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>SPI is normally a point-to-point connection, or sometimes one-to-many.
	It can be relatively fast (e.g. up to 25&#160;mbps).  It requires four
	wires for bidirectional communication but supports <em>full-duplex</em>
	transfer with simultaneous input and output.  Output-only connections
	can use just three wires.  It is designed for short-range connection to
	simple devices such as a chain of LED modules or a high-resolution
	ADC.</li>

      <li>I<sup>2</sup>C can connect multiple devices on a single bus.  It is
      relatively low speed, typically 400&#160;kbps to one&#160;mbps.  It
      uses three wires with separate clock and data but is half-duplex.  The
      protocols are more elaborate and involve specific phases of transmitting
      device addresses and receiving replies.  It is designed for short-range
      connection within a single system.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>In general, using a device-level serial bus requires using two libraries:
      one to handle the I<sup>2</sup>C or SPI data transfer, and one to handle
      the specific protocol for the device.  If no device library is available,
      then this involves understanding the datasheet for the particular device
      well enough to implement the required protocol.  This can be as simple as
      emitting a few bytes to write a value to a device register, but
      sophisticated devices can require elaborate programs to handle a variety
      of messages.  For example, a real-time clock-calendar chip can have dozens
      of registers available over an I<sup>2</sup>C bus to keep track of time
      and set alarms.</p>


    <p>This exercise will use the 
      <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/815">Adafruit 815 16 channel 12-bit PWM driver with I2C interface</a>.
      This module is based on the
      <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/PCA9685.pdf">PCA9685 I2C-bus controlled 16-channel LED controller</a>.
      Adafruit <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/16-channel-pwm-servo-driver">provides their own tutorial</a>, and
      <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-PWM-Servo-Driver-Library">library source code on github</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Download or find the complete <code>Adafruit_PWM</code> sketch included with the exercise.  This is the 
	pwmtest example from Adafruit-PWM-Servo-Driver-Library, slightly modified into a self-contained sketch.
	If you have cloned the course materials from github, it will be in the same folder as this page, or it can be
	<a href="http://cmuphyscomp.github.io/physcomp-examples/1_energy-information-transduction/b_arduino-starter/iv_serial-interfaces/1.b.iv.1_Adafruit-PWM-I2C/Adafruit_PWM/">
	  downloaded direct from github</a>.  Be sure to fetch all top-level
	  files.</li>

      <li>Load the sketch into the Arduino IDE and use Verify to make sure it compiles on your system.</li>
      
      <li>Plug the PWM module into a breadboard and use solid wire to make the following four connections from the Arduino to the module:
	<ol>
	  <li>5V -&gt; VCC</li>
	  <li>GND -&gt; GND</li>
	  <li>A4 -&gt; SDA</li>
	  <li>A5 -&gt; SCL</li>
	</ol>
      </li>

      <li>Connect the Arduino to your computer and download the sketch.</li>

      <li>Using an oscilloscope, observe the SCL clock line and the SDA data
	line.  You should see complex digital waveforms.  At the right time
	scale, you should be able to see regular bursts of pulses on the clock
	line and varying bursts on the data line.  Each burst is about 200
	microseconds long and represents a command message being sequentially
	shifted between the two devices.</li>

      <li>Using an oscilloscope, observe several of the PWM pins on the 3x4
	headers.  You should see a smoothly varying PWM waveform.</li>

      <li>Touch an LED between a PWM and GND pin (observing polarity) and you
	should see a smoothly varying illumination.  This module includes 220
	ohm resistors in series with the output so no dropping resistor is
	necessary.  If you attach several LEDs, you can see the smooth pattern
	produced by the example program.</li>

    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>This example is more about becoming comfortable using vendor libraries
      than the electronics, given how simple it is to make the electrical
      connections.</p>

    <p>For a challenge, clone the original Adafruit library from github and
      install it in your Arduino IDE libraries path, then try compiling the
      original unmodified example.</p>
