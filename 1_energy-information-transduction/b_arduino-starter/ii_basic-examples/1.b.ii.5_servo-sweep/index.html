    <h2>Exercise: Servo Sweep</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>
 
    <p>Control a hobby servomotor module.</p>

    <p>Hobby servos are feedback-controlled motors which move an output shaft to
      a specified position.  Internally they use a potentiometer to measure the
      actual position.  The internal circuit compares the actual and commanded
      position and generates positive and negative motor current pulses to
      operate a tiny gearmotor.  They are a very convenient modular way to
      create controlled physical motion.</p>

    <p>The commanded position is specified using a specific format of PWM in
      which pulses with duration approximately 1-2&#160;ms repeat at
      approximately 50&#160;Hz.  The different pulse widths correspond to
      different positions.  Note that this a significantly different waveform
      than the motor PWM, since the <em>duty cycle</em> is always very low,
      i.e., the pulse on-time is always much shorter than the cycle time.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Load and run the Servo/Sweep sketch.  This uses the Servo library, an included add-on to the base library.</li>
      <li>Observe the servo motion.</li>
      <li>Observe the PWM command signal on the oscilloscope.</li>
      <li>Try varying the numbers governing the motion limits.</li>
      <li>Try varying the delay to change the speed.</li>
      <li>Determine the maximum speed possible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>Note that trajectories and speed control are only possible by issuing position commands at intervals.</p>

    <p>As a challenge, rewrite the program to avoid <code>delay()</code> and
      operate two servos simultanously on different trajectories.  This will be
      taken up in more detail in an upcoming exercise.</p>
