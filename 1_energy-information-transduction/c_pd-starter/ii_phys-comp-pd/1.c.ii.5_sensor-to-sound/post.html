<h4>Objective</h4>
 
    <p>Map a physical measurement to a synthesized sound using Arduino input into Pd.</p>

    <p>Please review the notes for 1.c.ii.1 as all of them apply to this
      exercise as well.  This exercise assumes you have an Arduino programmed
      with the OneInOneOutASCII sketch to communicate physical data to and from
      an Arduino.  The Pd patches are available in the same materials folder as
      this file.</p>

    <p>This exercise is almost identical to the previous 1.c.ii.32 Sensor to GUI
      exercise, only the mapping is from a sensor to a synthesized sound.  This
      is a transition into more advanced audio processing in Pd.
    </p>
    

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>Open the 1.c.iii.1_sensor-to-sound.pd patch in Pd-extended.</li>
      
      <li>Open the connection to the Arduino using one of the serial port name
	message objects.</li>

      <li>Enable audio processing by clicking the green Enable_Audio button.</li>
 
      <li>Touch the A0 pin with your finger; just the electrical noise from your finger should be enough signal to trigger the synthesizer.</li>

      <li>Attach an analog sensor to A0 and see if it makes a playable instrument.</li>
      
      <li>Try varying the sliders in the Oscillator Bank section of the patch to
	change the sound properties.</li>

    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>
    
    <p>There is a lot going on in the synthesizer; in the following exercises we
      will isolate more components of Pd signal processing and work back towads
      this kind of complexity.</p>
