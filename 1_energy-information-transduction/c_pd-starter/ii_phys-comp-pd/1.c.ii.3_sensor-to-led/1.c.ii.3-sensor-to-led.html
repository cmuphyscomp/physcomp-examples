    <h4>Objective</h4>
 
    <p>Map a physical measurement through Pure Data from an Arduino input to output.</p>

    <p>Please review the notes for 1.c.ii.1 as all of them apply to this
      exercise as well.  This exercise assumes you have an Arduino programmed
      with the OneInOneOutASCII sketch to communicate physical data to and from
      an Arduino.  The Pd patches are available in the same materials folder as
      this file.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>Open the 1.c.ii.3_SensorToLED.pd patch in Pd-extended.</li>
      
      <li>Open the connection to the Arduino using one of the serial port name
	message objects.</li>

      <li>After it starts, you should see time and analog values appear in the patch.</li>

      <li>The console should show the outgoing PWM commands.</li>

      <li>Attach an analog sensor to A0 and LED to Pin 2 as illustrated and see the change in display.</li>

    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>
    
    <p>Looping the data through Pd adds significant latency.  Can you get a LED
      and optical sensor to oscillate by changing the numerical mapping and
      physically positioning the devices?</p>
