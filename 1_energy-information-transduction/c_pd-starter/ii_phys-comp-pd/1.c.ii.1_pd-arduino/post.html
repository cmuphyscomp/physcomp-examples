<h4>Objective</h4>
 
    <p>Communicate data between Pure Data and an Arduino using the USB serial bus.</p>

    <p>The Arduino IDE and Pure Data solve different problems well.  The Arduino
      has easy direct access to its hardware interface, and can create and
      respond to electrical signals with very low latency.  Pure Data is
      well-suited to interactive real-time programming, but the latency and
      jitter is considerable higher than on a microcontroller, and on a laptop
      lacks access to hardware interfaces.  This exercise will demonstrate one
      way of coordinating Pure Data and the Arduino to take advantage of the
      best features of each by linking them using a simple ASCII message
      protocol over the USB serial bus.</p>

    <p>The serial communication does introduce significant latency between the
      Arduino and Pd, so this approach is strongest for systems in which Pd is
      used for tasks such as the GUI, visual display, sequencing, and overall
      event control.  It would not be suitable for high-bandwidth tasks such as
      cycling individual digital outputs to create a stepper motor waveform.
      However, the extensibility of the protocol means that you can add those
      low-level hardware behaviors to the Arduino client program and invoke them
      via messages.</p>

    <p>Setting up the exercise requires a couple of preparatory steps:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Compiling and loading the OneInOneOutASCII Arduino sketch on an Arduino Uno.</li>
      <li>Determining the exact name of the serial port offered by the Arduino over USB.</li>
      <li>Running the OneInOneOutAsciiTest PureData patch in pd-extended on your laptop.  (The patch requires the moocow library and won't work in 'vanilla' Pd.)</li>
      <li>Verifying or setting the serial port name in the patch.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The OneInOneOutASCII sketch is provided in the course distribution in the
      folder named support/Arduino/OneInOneOutASCII.  If you have not cloned the
      course materials from github, you
      can <a href="http://cmuphyscomp.github.io/physcomp-examples/support/Arduino/OneInOneOutASCII/OneInOneOutASCII.ino">download
      it directly from github</a>.  The source code of the sketch provides
      details of the messaging scheme</p>

    <p>The Pd patch is available in the same materials folder as this file or 
      <a href="http://cmuphyscomp.github.io/physcomp-examples/1_energy-information-transduction/c_pd-starter/ii_phys-comp-pd/1.c.ii.1_pd-arduino/OneInOneOutAsciiTest.pd">
	directly from github</a>.

    </p><h4>Steps and observations</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>Upload the OneInOneOutASCII sketch onto an Arduino Uno.  </li>

      <li>Open the Serial Monitor, set the baud rate to 115200 and the line
	ending to Newline.  You should see data messages start to stream
	by.</li>

      <li>Enter 'poll 1000' in the input box and press enter.  The message rate should slow.</li>
      <li>Enter 'led 0' in the input box and press enter.  The LED marked L should go off.</li>
      <li>Enter 'led 1' in the input box and press enter.  The LED marked L should go on again.</li>
      <li>Note the exact serial port name from the Tools/Port menu in the Arduino IDE.</li>
      <li>Exit the Arduino IDE and load the OneInOneOutAsciiTest.pd patch in pd-extended.</li>

      <li>Near the top of the sketch are a set of message objects naming
	different serial ports.  If one matches the port name on your machine,
	click it to open the port.  If not, edit one of the boxes to match the
	port name and then click it.</li>

      <li>Right below is a toggle labeled LED.  Click it several times to send
	led control messages and observe the Arduino LED.  On each press you
	should also see the RX LED flash briefly as the message is received on
	the Arduino.</li>

      <li>Further down on the patch is a number box labeled 'Time'.  Verify that
	it is continuously changing with the microsecond clock values from the
	Arduino.</li>

      <li>Explore the other GUI areas on the patch.</li>

    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>
    
    <p>This particular Arduino IDE sketch is going to serve as the basis for all
      the following exercises in which we connect hardware to the Arduino and
      control it from Pd.</p>

    <p>For a challenge, examine the source code for both the sketch and the
      patch and work out how to add additional message types.</p>
