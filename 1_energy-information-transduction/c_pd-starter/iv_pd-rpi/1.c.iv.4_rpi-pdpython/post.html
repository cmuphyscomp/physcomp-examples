<h4>Objective</h4>
    
    <p>Use Python to access hardware via wiringPi; use Python classes from within
    Pd.</p>

    <p>This exercise assumes you have the basic Raspberry Pi materials as
      specified in 1.c.iv.1.</p>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>The strength of Pure Data is its intrinsic parallelism and ease of
      incremental, interactive programming.  However, Python is a great language
      for quick prototyping and is frequently taught as an introductory
      text-based programming language.  The wiringpi2 module enables Python to
      use the wiringPi library for direct hardware access on the Raspberry Pi.
      </p>

    <p>We are also providing the pdpython Pd external as a means of combining
      the strength of Pd and Python.  It allows instances of Python classes to
      be created as Pd objects.  Pd messages are mapped to function calls; with
      some care, a system can be built which maintains the real-time character
      of Pd.  One pragmatic application is that the Python wiringPi interface is
      considerably more complete than the one offered by pdwiringPi.</p><p>

    </p><h4>Steps and observations</h4>

    <ol>

      <li>Find the <code>pwm_soft_and_hard.py</code> script and examine the
	text, e.g. using the <code>more</code> command.  It sets up the hardware
	PWM output and then generates a second PWM signal in software.</li>

      <li>Run the script using sudo: <code>sudo python pwm_soft_and_hard.py</code></li>
      
      <li>Using an oscilloscope, look at the hardware PWM signal on BCM
	18/Physical 12 and the software PWM signal on BCM 23/Physical 16.  There
	is usually a substantial difference in signal stability and
	frequency.</li>

      <li>Stop the Python script using Control-C.</li>

      <li>Examine the contents of <code>pd_helper.py</code>.  This is a module
      which can be loaded into Pd that contains a few miscellaneous test
      functions.</li>

      <li>Load the patch in Pd: <code>sudo pd 1.c.iv.4_rpi-pdpython.pd</code></li>

      <li>Follow the text in the patch: it demonstrates how the Python functions
	are called from Pd.</li>

    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>
    
    <p>The actual pdpython code in this exercise is slightly contrived in the
      interests of providing simplified examples.  A few more examples
      highlighting different techniques can be found in the pdpython source at
      <code>/opt/cmuphyscomp/src/pdpython/examples</code> or 
      <a href="https://github.com/garthz/pdpython/tree/master/examples">online at github</a>.</p>

    <p>A practical example from the course is the conductor patch for assignment
      1.c.v, as it uses Python data structures to keep track of clients
      connecting over the network.  This is a natural task for Python and
      simpler than the equivalent in vanilla Pd.</p>
