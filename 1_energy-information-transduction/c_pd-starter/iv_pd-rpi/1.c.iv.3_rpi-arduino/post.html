<h4>Objective</h4>
    
    <p>Use an Arduino Uno as an accessory to a Raspberry Pi.</p>

    <p>This exercise assumes you have the basic Raspberry Pi materials as
      specified in 1.c.iv.1, as well as the following materials:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Arduino Uno with USB cable.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>The Raspberry Pi GPIO interface is great for easy and fast interfacing to
      individual digital I/O lines and SPI and I<sup>2</sup>C busses.  However,
      there are still circumstances under which using an Arduino makes sense.
      Even though the Raspberry Pi is much, much faster than an Arduino, Linux
      is not a real time system and so other processes can interfere with the
      precise timing of your program.  And many devices have exising libraries
      for the Arduino, so the fastest way to test a part can be to use the
      existing Arduino code but transmit the data to and from the Raspberry Pi
      for display and further processing.</p>

    <p>Some specific rationale for using the Arduino/Pi combination would be a
      project requiring features compelling both an Arduino and a Pi:</p><p>

    </p><p>Requirements motivating a Raspberry Pi: networking, graphics, audio
      signal processing, machine learning, databases, data logging, machine
      vision, extensive numerical computations, use of Python or Pure Data,
      libraries available under Linux, transferring an existing Pure Data patch
      into embedded form.</p>

    <p>Requirements motivating an Arduino: simple analog input, rapid start-up
      (e.g. no boot time), existing hardware device libraries, tight signal
      timing requirements, fast digital pattern generation such as for driving a
      stepper motor.</p>

    <p>With enough work, many of these Arduino requirements can be satisfied
      with just a Pi and additional hardware such as an external ADC, but may
      require porting device libraries.  The timing can be improved by adjusting
      Linux process priorities and disabling unneeded services.</p>
    
    <p>But a short startup time is the hardest requirement to overcome with the
      Pi by itself.  So for example, a sophisticated project might ideally have
      a failsafe mode in which the Arduino can still provide minimum behavior
      while the Raspberry Pi is booting up or in case of program failure.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>Using a laptop, program the OneInOneOutASCII Arduino sketch onto an
	Arduino Uno.  (This is also possible from the Pi, but faster from a
	laptop.)  This is available in the physcomp-examples/support/Arduino
	folder.</li>

      <li>Attach the Arduino to any of the Raspberry Pi USB ports.</li>

      <li>Locate the <b>1.c.ii.1 Pure Data and Arduino</b> exercise material on
	  the Raspberry Pi.  The course image for the Pi includes this at the
	  following location:
	  /opt/cmuphyscomp/physcomp-examples/1_energy-information-transduction/c_pd-starter/ii_phys-comp-pd/1.c.ii.1_pd-arduino/</li>

      <li>As before, run the OneInOneOutAsciiTest.pd patch in pd.  This can be
	done from the command line as <code>pd OneInOneOutAsciiTest.pd</code>.
	Note that no special permissions are required; Pure Data will
	communicate with the Arduino over USB and not access the Pi
	hardware.</li>

      <li>Click on the [/dev/ttyACM0] message near the top of the patch.  This
	is the name given to the Arduino serial device under Linux.  (If it
	doesn't work, click the [devices] message and examine the console
	output.)</li>

      <li>As before, examine the Time box for clock data from the Arduino, try
	the LED toggle, examine the A0 input box with analog data.</li>

    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>
    
    <p>A useful tool for debugging the Arduino connection from the Raspberry Pi
      is the <code>minicom</code> text-mode terminal emulator which can be run
      from the command line.  The minicom commands are prefixed with Control-A:
      type <b>Control-A Z</b> to see a menu, or <b>Control-A Q</b> to quit.</p>
