    <h2>Exercise: Using WiringPi on the Raspberry Pi</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>
    
    <p>Use basic digital I/O on a Raspberry Pi from the command line and Pd.</p>

    <p>This exercise assumes you have the basic Raspberry Pi materials as specified in 1.c.iv.1, as well as the following
      materials:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>switch</li>
      <li>10K resistor</li>
      <li>incandescent bulb</li>
      <li>2N3904 transistor</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b-plus/">Raspberry Pi B+</a> we have in stock include
      <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bplus-gpio.png">40-pin
	header</a> with a number of digital I/O pins, including I<sup>2</sup>C and
      SPI busses.  One pin (GPIO18, pin number 12) can generate high-frequency
      PWM signals.  Analog to digital conversion can be performed by attaching
      an external ADC via either SPI or I<sup>2</sup>C.</p>

    <p>We are using the <a href="http://wiringpi.com/">wiringPi interface
	library</a> for convenient access to this hardware interface.
      The <code>gpio</code> command-line program is a quick way to inspect and
      configure the state of the interface.  We also provide
      a <a href="https://github.com/garthz/pdwiringPi">pdwiringPi</a> external
      for Pure Data for basic access from Pd patches.  For more advanced
      usage, we provide
      the <a href="https://github.com/Gadgetoid/WiringPi2-Python">WiringPi2-Python</a>
      module for hardware access from Python scripts.  It is also possible to
      write C/C++ programs which directly use libwiringPi.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>

    <p><b>The gpio command.</b> The simplest way way to see what
      the <code>gpio</code> command can do is just run it; it will print out a
      list of options.  The <code>gpio readall</code> command will show a table
      with the current state of all the interface pins.</p>

    <p><b>Pin numbering.</b> There are three different ways that the pins are
      numbered, which can be confusing.  The physical pins numbers are defined
      by
      the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bplus-gpio.png">40-pin
	header</a> in the conventional order.  The CPU defines a numbering based
      on the internal GPIO device registers; these are referred to as the
      <b>Broadcom</b> or <b>BCM</b> numbers by wiringPi, but are
      shown as GPIO on the Raspberry Pi diagram.</p>

    <p>Confusingly enough, the wiringPi library and gpio command define another
      pin numbering scheme, show in the readall display as the <b>wPi</b>
      columns, next to the <b>BCM</b> columns showing the Broadcom hardware
      scheme, and the <b>Physical</b> columns at the center with the the
      physical scheme.</p>

    <p><b>Reading an input.</b>  Set up the circuit in the associated diagram
      with a switch and pullup resistor attached to physical pin 11 and 3.3V.
      Note that the Raspberry Pi is a 3.3V device, so digital inputs should not
      exceed the 3.3V supply voltage.</p>

    <p>Then try the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Configure WiringPi pin 0 (BCM 17, physical pin 11) as an input:<br/>
	<code>gpio mode 0 input</code><br/></li>

      <li>Read the state of pin 0 as follows, which should change with the state of the button:<br/>
	<code>gpio read 0</code></li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>Configuring a digital output.</b> The following steps will control a
      lightbulb on physical pin 12/BCM 18/wPi 1.  The Pi doesn't provide enough
      current or voltage for the lightbulb, so you will need to use an external
      power source with a 2N3904 transistor. Connect the base pin of the
      transistor to physical pin 12 from the Pi.  Then try the following:
      </p><ol>
	<li>Configure WiringPi pin 1 (BCM 18, physical pin 12) as an output:<br/>
	  <code>gpio mode 1 output</code></li>

	<li>Write the state of wPi 1 as follows, which should turn the light on and off:<br/>
	  <code>gpio write 1 1</code><br/>
	  <code>gpio write 1 0</code></li>
      </ol>
      
    <p><b>Configuring a PWM output.</b> Using the same circuit, this will configure the pin for PWM output for variable brightness:
      </p><ol>
	<li>Configure WiringPi pin 1 (BCM 18, physical pin 12) for PWM output:<br/>
	  <code>gpio mode 1 pwm</code></li>

	<li>Set the lightbulb to half-brightness:<br/>
	  <code>gpio pwm 1 512</code></li>
      </ol>



    <p><b>Using wiringPi from Pd.</b>  Find the associated Pd patch and run it
      as follows: <code>sudo pd 1.c.iv.2_rpi-pdwiringPi.pd</code>. Pure Data
      needs to be launched with root privileges for fast hardware access.  The
      text within the patch explains the next few steps, which replicate the
      previous steps within Pd.</p>
