    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> is a powerful
      microcontroller which runs the Linux operating system.  We are using the
      B+ version, which has 512&nbsp;Mb RAM and a 40-pin connector for hardware
      I/O.  It boots from a microSD card which acts as its hard drive.  It is
      about as powerful as a low-end cell phone, which puts it orders of
      magnitude more complex than an Arduino, but much less capable than a
      current laptop.</p>

    <p>The Raspberry Pi is a vastly more powerful computer than the Arduino and
      has access to a vast array of Linux software, much of which is easily
      available in packaged form.  It makes it possible to easily embed computer
      vision, audio processing, networking, data logging, 3D graphics, web
      services, etc. in a small device.</p>

    <p>The downside of this is increased complexity.  Unlike the Arduino, it
      takes a few tens of seconds to boot up.  Programs can be written using
      many languages but the programming environment generally lacks the
      simplicity of the Arduino IDE.</p>

    <p>We have tried to bundle a rich set of tools in a standard system to make
      it as easy as we can to get started.  We have the [wiringPi] object for Pd
      which can directly control hardware I/O pins.  For those so inclined, the
      wiringPi-Python library allows easy programming in Python.  If you want to
      blend the two, the [pdpython] object enables building mixed systems.  And
      it is also possible to program in C, C++, Javascript, Perl, e.g., any
      major language available for Linux.</p>

    <h4>Interaction with the Pi</h4>

    <p>This exercise is about becoming familiar with the infrastructure and
      getting to the point of basic usability.  There are a couple of different
      ways in which people use the Pi:</p>

    <p><b>As a standalone computer.</b>  It is possible to plug a monitor,
      keyboard, mouse, and network port directly into a Pi and just treat it
      like a desktop computer.  The upside is the relative simplicity of getting
      started and the possibility of generating 3D graphics directly on a
      monitor.  The downside is that the Pi is a slow computer, and burdening it
      with generating a desktop display makes it feel slow.  Plus needing all
      the accessories defeats some of the point of using a tiny computer.  We
      only recommend this mode as a startup step or for a disconnected system
      off the network.</p>

    <p><b>As a X11 client.</b> The X11 system dates back to the 1980s but is
      still a viable means for running graphical user interfaces across the
      network.  The laptop runs an X11 server (e.g. XQuartz.app) which handles
      drawing on the screen on behalf of a program running on the Pi,
      communicating over the network via SSH. This method works well for running
      Pure Data on the Pi from a laptop.  This method can work over WiFi, but is
      much more reliable on a direct Ethernet connection.</p>

    <p><b>As a SSH server.</b> Much of the Pi can be operated from the command
      line.  An ssh client on a laptop can connect to the Pi for an interactive
      console session.  This works over even a slow network connection, and
      works fine for text editors with console modes (e.g. emacs).</p>

    <p><b>As a remote desktop.</b>  It is possible to use a standard remote
      desktop interface on a laptop to open the Raspberry Pi desktop as a
      window.  This can be familiar, but also can feel slow since the Pi is
      still generating a full display.  The advantage is the minimal amount of
      hardware, since the only accessory needed is a network connection.  This
      is really only a usable method across a direct Ethernet connection; the
      WiFi will be unusably slow.</p>

    <p><b>As a Web server.</b> We have installed Node-RED, which can be launched
      to provide a web-based programming interface.  This is not used in the
      course exercises, but might be viable for advanced students seeking to
      integrate the Pi hardware with web services.</p>

    <h4>Data Storage on the Pi</h4>

    <p>We have installed an updatable image of the course materials on the Pi
      microSD, so it should be possible to work through the exercises as-is.
      But once you begin copying the templates and generating your own project
      code and data, you'll want ways to get your personal files on and off the
      Pi.</p>

    <p><b>Using shared folders.</b>  We have set up a Samba server on the Pi
      which allows drag and drop file access from a laptop.</p>

    <p><b>Using a USB drive.</b>  The Pi can mount filesystems from USB sticks
      and external hard drives.</p>

    <p><b>Using a SFTP client.</b>  Desktop and command-line SFTP clients
      (e.g. Fugu.app or sftp) can remotely access the Pi filesystem.  In many
      ways, this is more reliable than the Samba system, since there is no
      persistent connection.  Sftp is better for transferring individual files
      rather than nested folders.</p>
    
    <p><b>Using rsync or unison.</b> These are programs which perform single- or
      bi-directional file synchronization between a laptop and the Pi, but which
      require some careful configuration.  These are suitable for nested folders
      and large sets of files.</p>

    <h4>Maintenance of the Pi</h4>
    
    <p>The Linux system on the Pi is a complex infrastructure involving many
      parts which can be individually updated.  Your program is always one of
      many.</p>

    <p>We have provided an update system (the 'puppet' system) which can help
      with keeping your Pi up to date as the course evolves.</p>


    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>

    <p>We will walk through these steps as a class demonstration, since there
    are many steps which are hard to document.</p>

    <p><b>Preparation.</b> Gather the materials listed above.  Install your
      microSD card.</p>

    <p><b>Getting connected.</b> If using a cluster laptop, install the Ethernet
      adapter and attach an Ethernet cable from it to the Pi. </p>

    <p><b>First contact using ssh.</b> If using a cluster laptop, open System
      Preferences/Sharing and enable Internet Sharing so the laptop can bridge
      the Pi to the internet.  Attach power to the Pi and watch the lights
      flicker as it boots.  Try a command-line ssh connection from a Terminal
      window.  The Pi is preconfigured to use address 192.168.2.3, so from
      a Terminal window try the following: <code>ssh pi@192.168.2.3</code>.  If
      successful, you'll see a password prompt: the default password
      is <code>raspberry</code>.  If successful, you'll see a Linux command
      prompt.  Try <code>ls -l</code> to get a listing of files.</p>

    <p><b>First contact using monitor.</b> If using a monitor, connect the HDMI
      monitor, USB keyboard and mouse, and then attach power to the Pi.  You
      should see a stream of boot messages on the screen culminating in a login
      prompt.  The default username is <code>pi</code> and password
      is <code>raspberry</code>.  If successful, you should see a Linux
      desktop.</p>

    <p><b>Graphical operation using X11 over ssh.</b> If using a cluster laptop,
      log out of the console connection, and the log back in with the -X
      flag: <code>ssh -X pi@192.168.2.3</code>.  You'll again see a Linux
      command prompt.  Try the <code>xterm</code> command; the laptop should
      launch XQuartz and open a window with a terminal emulator.  If that works,
      try the <code>pd</code> command; it should launch Pure Data with windows
      appearing on the laptop.</p>

    <p><b>Updating using the puppet system.</b> If using a cluster laptop, try
      the following command to check your network connectivity: <code>ping
      www.cmu.edu</code>.  If that fails, you'll need to debug the network
      connection.  The <code>ifconfig</code> command will show you the current
      network configuration on the Pi.  Other useful network
      commands: <code>hostname -I</code> to check the current IP
      address, <code>host www.cmu.edu</code> to test name service, and <code>dig
      www.cmu.edu</code> to test name service in detail. (For details: <code>man
      dig</code> to read the manual page).</p>

    <p>If your Pi is able to connect to the internet, try running an update
	with <code>sudo pi_update --course</code>.  That will update the
	contents of the <code>/opt/cmuphyscomp/physcomp-examples/</code> folder
	to the current course materials.  To run all available updates, you may
	use <code>sudo pi_update</code>, but that can take a few minutes.</p>

    <p><b>Getting files on and off the Pi.</b> TBD.</p>
