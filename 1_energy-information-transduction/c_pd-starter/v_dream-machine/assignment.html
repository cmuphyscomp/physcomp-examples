    <h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Create an enchanted object that uses sound, light and movement to create
      a dream-like state for the audience.</p>

    <p>We will perform these machines simultaneously for a coordinated,
      collaborative, dream experience.  The performance will be coordinated over
      the network from a conductor who provides simple musical cues including
      tempo and loudness. The machines must include some kind of physical
      output, e.g. light, sound, or movements.  They may be entirely autonomous,
      responding only to the conductor, or may include some kind of physical
      input to allow a performer to modulate the output in order collaborate
      with the ensemble.</p>
    
    <p>As a challenge, the Pd digital synthesis techniques may be employed to
      also provide a synthesized sound and/or image from a laptop which
      harmonizes with the physical performance of your object and others.</p>

    <p>We will set up the performance during class time in the Media Lab
      adjacent to the Physical Computing Lab; please make sure your device can
      be easily moved.  We will carry over power supplies as needed.</p>

    <p>Creating sound with physical means is older than recorded history.  The 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel%E2%80%93Sachs">Hornbostel–Sachs
	system is a classic taxonomy of instruments</a> which may inspire you.
	Virtually any object can create sound if mechanical energy is supplied
	to it in an appropriate way.</p>
    
    <h4>Deliverables</h4>

    <p>The deliverables are divided in two parts.<p>
      <ol>
	<li><p><b>First Iteration.</b> For the first deadline, we would like to
	    see a first draft of the machine.  The key requirement is a device
	    which be performed, demonstrated, and explained, which implements
	    some or all of the project idea.  Some possible outcomes: a complete
	    hardware solution with minimal software; a fully worked subsystem; a
	    maquette or model with developed software; or a complete rough pass
	    through all elements.  We suggest you choose the most ambiguous or
	    difficult part and explore that first.</p>

	  <p>Note that no additional documentation beyond the device itself is
	    required for the first iteration.  However, the device must be ready
	    to perform in some capacity.</p>
	</li>
	
	<li><p><b>Second Iteration.</b> For the second deadline, we would like to see a
	    final device with fully developed form and behavior, and documentation on
	    the blog as described in the syllabus.</p>

	  <p>We suggest you plan carefully what kinds of questions can be answered in
	    the second phase to demonstrate a clear development.</p>
	</li>
      </ol>

    
    <h4>Template</h4>

    <p>The instrument/ folder contains a template for a Pd patch for controlling
      the assignment.  The template contains the code which handles the network
      communication with the conductor.  It also has a copy of the conductor
      control interface which can be used for offline testing.  You should copy
      this template and replace the sample instrument with your own Arduino
      communication and synthesis patch.</p>

    <p>The conductor/ folder contains the Pd patch for the conductor's control
      station. It includes the network code for listening for instruments
      joining the performance and then sending a steady stream of rhythmic and
      parametric data to each participating instrument.</p>
