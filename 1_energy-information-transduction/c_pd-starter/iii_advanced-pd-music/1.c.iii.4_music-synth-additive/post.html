<h4>Objective</h4>
 
    <p>Using PureData to explore <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_synthesis">additive audio synthesis</a>.</em> </p>
    <p>Realworld sounds are made up of many frequency components. We can accordingly add up multiplepure tones (sinusoids) to create more complext timbres.</p>
    <p>This exercise implements a basic additive synthesizer; it is made up of 10 independent oscillators, each with their own frequency and amplitude. The frequencies and amplitudes for all oscillators are stored in two tables.</p>
  <h4>Steps and observations</h4>

  <ol>
      <li>Open the 1.c.iii.4_music-synth-additive.pd patch in Pd-extended.</li>
      
    <li>Change the contents of the frequency table and listen for the effects</li>
    <li>Change the contents of the amplitude table and listen for the effect</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>
    
    <p>For a challenge,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>build a patch that dynamically changes the frequencies and amplitudes in an additive synthesizer</li>
      <li>create a timbre that is very <em>consonent</em></li>
      <li>create a timbre that is very <em>dissonant</em></li>
  </ul>
