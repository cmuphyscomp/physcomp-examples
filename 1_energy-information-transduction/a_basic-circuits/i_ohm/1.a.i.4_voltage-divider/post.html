<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Measure voltages and compute current flow in a resistive voltage divider.</p>

    <p>Many sensor circuits we use will be built around an arrangement of series
      resistances called a <em>voltage divider</em>.  This is a fundamental
      construction will will appear again and again.</p>

    <p>Two resistors in series form a single current pathway, so a voltage
      applied across the pair will cause the same current to flow through each
      of them.  However, the voltage drop across each resistor resulting from
      that current is proportional to the resistance <span class="eqn">(V = i *
      R)</span>, so the voltage at the intermediate node depends on the relative
      resistances.  In the simplest case, if both resistances are the same, the
      voltage in the middle will be the average of the voltage at each end.</p>

    <p>We will use the voltage divider structure to allow a variable resistance
      (e.g. sensor or switch) to control the voltage at the intermediate point.
      This is useful for us because the analog-to-digital converter on the
      Arduino senses applied voltage.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Measure the exact resistance of each resistor.</li>

      <li>Carefully measure the voltage Vin applied across the series pair of
      resistors.</li>

      <li>Compute the expected voltage V1 across the grounded
	resistor: <span class="eqn">V1 = Vin * (R1 / (R1+R2))</span>, where R2
	is the 'upper' resistor connected to the positive supply and R1 is the
	'lower' resistor connected to ground.</li>

      <li>Vary the input voltage and repeat; you should be able to convince
	yourself that the intermediate voltage scales proportionately.</li>

      <li>Open the circuit and measure the actual current through the divider.
	Compare against the predicted value <span class="eqn">i = Vin / (R1+R2)</span>.</li>
