    <h2>Exercise: Transducer with DMM</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Measure the response of a modular sensor.</p>

    <p>Many sensors are available as convenient modules which incorporate the
    required support components.  In this example, the module simply requires
    regulated power to directly output an analog voltage representing a physical
    property.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>

      <li>Double-check the power supply voltage before connecting to the
      circuit.  Many modules require tightly regulated voltage and will be
      destroyed at higher input voltages and malfunction at lower input
      voltages.</li>

      <li>Measure the output voltage at different physical conditions.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>A <em>buffered</em> or <em>amplified</em> module can drive a modest
      current through the output if needed; it has a <em>low-impedance</em>
      output.  Many unbuffered or unamplified sensors only output a small
      current or voltage and require an amplifier to bring the signal to a
      usable level.</p>

    <p>When in doubt, consult the datasheet or spec sheet for the module for
      specific ratings on supply voltage and details of the output signal.</p>

    <p>For a challenge, try testing a GP2Y0A21YK0F Analog Distance Sensor: these
      are very useful active sensors which emit infrared light and measure the
      distance to the nearest object using the parallax of the reflection.</p>

    <p>Other challenges: try testing a joystick, the &#8220;Electret
      Microphone&#8221; module which measures the overall sound energy level, or
      the ENC-03RC single axis gyro.  These are all sensors with analog outputs;
      some of the other stock communicates digitally over I<sup>2</sup>C, which
      will use in a later exercise.</p>
