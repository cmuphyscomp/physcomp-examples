<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Measure mechanical pressure as a varying voltage.</p>

    <p>A <em>pressure pad</em>
      (i.e. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Sensitive_Resistor">force-sensing resistor</a>, or FSR)
      is a contact sensor in which the resistance
      changes in response to mechanical pressure. The resistance decreases with increased force.
    A voltage divider circuit can be used for forming a voltage which depends on the pressure.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>The circuit diagram shows a homebrew conductive fabric FSR but you
	may use a commercial FSR at first.  These are labeled &#8220;pressure
	sensor&#8221; and can be found in the Sensors cabinet.</li>
      <li>Measure the resistance of the pressure pad by itself over different pressure conditions.</li>
      <li>The exact value of the bias resistor depends on the properties of your
	sensor.  A good starting point is a resistance equal to the mid-range
	resistance of the sensor.</li>
      <li>Measure the pressure pad voltage in the given circuit over different pressure conditions.</li>
      <li>Using the oscilloscope to observe the pressure pad voltage, try creating rapidly changing contact to estimate the response speed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>Commercial FSRs can be damaged by excessive force.  In practice, it can
      take care to design them within a mechanical assembly so they are not
      directly exposed to excessive force or forces which pull them apart.  But
      they are a relatively cheap and robust way to make an analog human
      interface.</p>

    <p>As a challenge, rather than use a packaged FSR device, make your own
      using tape and conductive fabric.  Please see the following as a
      guide.</p>

    <p>Conductive fabric can also be damaged by excessive force and can some
      types can wear out from washing.  But these sensors can be incorporated
      into clothing, made with multiple sensitive points, turned into tilt
      sensors and linear controls, etc.</p>
