    <h2>Exercise: Smoke a Resistor</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Destroy a resistor to observe the effects of excessive dissipation.
    Destroy a red LED to observe the non-linear current characteristic.</p>

    <p>Resistors generate heat as current flows through them.  If the applied
      voltage rises too high, they will heat up until they smoke or melt.  The
      power dissipated is the voltage drop multiplied by the
      current: <span class="eqn">P = V * i</span>.  Since the voltage drop
      across a resistor is proportional to the current <span class="eqn">(V = i
      * R)</span>, the power dissipated can also be expressed
      as <span class="eqn"> P = i<sup>2</sup> * R</span> or
      <span class="eqn">P = V<sup>2</sup> / R</span>.</p>


    <p>The small resistors we use in the lab are rated for 0.25 Watts of
      dissipation.  So for example, a 100 ohm resistor will dissipate 0.25 Watts
      with an applied voltage of 5V: the current will be
      50&#160;mA <span class="eqn">(5V / 100 ohms)</span>, and the power will be
      0.25&#160;Watts <span class="eqn">(5V * 0.050 A)</span>.  As the voltage
      increases they will dissipate power according to the square of the
      voltage, so they will get hotter and hotter and quickly fail.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Adjust the power supply for 5V output.  Measure the resulting current
	through a 100 ohm quarter-watt resistor.</li>

      <li>Check if the resistor is getting warm.</li>

      <li>Raise the power supply to 7V output, which will double the dissipated
	energy to a half-Watt: <span class="eqn">P = V<sup>2</sup> / R = 7*7 /
	100 = 0.49W</span>.</li>

      <li>Check if the resistor getting warm.  Careful not to burn yourself.</li>

      <li>Continue raising the power voltage slowly until the resistor fails.
      Note the final voltage and current.</li>

      <li>As noted in the previous LED exercise, LEDs have a non-linear
	characteristic in which the current rapidly rises as the voltage climbs.
	Find an inexpensive red LED and measure its <em>forward voltage</em>
	using the diode measurement function on the DMM.  For a red LED, this
	will typically be in the vicinity of 1.6V.</li>

      <li>Set the power supply about half a volt below the forward voltage.
	Attach the LED.  Very slowly increase the applied voltage, observing the
	LED.  The light should get very bright very quickly around the forward
	voltage, and at just a slightly higher voltage, the LED will heat up and
	stop working permanently.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>Resistors are cheap, so this is pretty harmless, even if it smells bad.
      It is heartbreaking to overvoltage an expensive component and &#8220;let
      out the magic smoke&#8221; so it stops working.</p>
