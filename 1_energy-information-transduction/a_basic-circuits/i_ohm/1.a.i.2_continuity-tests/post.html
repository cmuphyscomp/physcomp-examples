<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Learn typical scale of resistance units.</p>

    <p>Metals are generally good at conducting electricity; they have low
    resistance.  Common insulators (including air) have a resistance high enough
    it can't be easily measured.  So the most basic resistance measurement is
    the 'continuity check' which simply tests whether the resistance is low
    enough to be considered a conductor, or whether it is unexpectedly high
    representing an open circuit.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>

      <li>Set the DMM to resistance: Ohms, or the large greek omega letter
	&#937;.  The DMM will emit a small voltage to measure the current which
	flows in response through the resistance path between the probes.</li>

      <li>Hold the probe tips in your fingers. This is safe, the DMM voltage
      emitted is very low.  Squeeze harder.  Moisten the contact point.  You
      should see a body resistance reading which changes with conditions.</li>

      <li>Touch the probes to a coin, keys, and metal tool surfaces.  If you
      fail to see a low reading, try changing contact points, scratching the
      surface, and pressing harder.</li>

      <li>Touch the probes across the leads of a resistor.  The quarter-watt
      resistors with wire leads we use in the lab
      have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_color_code">colored
      bands which encode the specified value</a>.</li>

      <li>Touch the probes across the leads of an LED.  Reverse the
      connections.</li>

      <li>Try measuring resistance through other natural objects, food,
      furniture, etc.  Write down your results.</li>

    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>Typical resistance measurements along a short wire will be less than 1
    ohm and are often dominated by the resistance of the contact point and probe
    wires.  Component resistors are available in standard ranges from a fraction
    of an ohm to tens of millions of ohms.  For our typical sensor circuits we
    will be using resistors in the 100 to 10000 (10K) ohm range.</p>
