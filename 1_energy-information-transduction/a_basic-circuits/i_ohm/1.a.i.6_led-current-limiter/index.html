    <h2>Exercise: LED with current limiter</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Light an LED using a safely limited current.</p>

    <p>An LED is a <em>Light Emitting Diode</em>, a type of semiconductor
      component which emits light directly from a current. The light results
      from energized electrons moving between quantum states, and so the light
      emitted has narrow spectral bands with color depending upon the specific
      chemical composition.  White LEDs are actually a composite structure of
      multiple LEDs of different colors.  White LED light is still narrow-band,
      unlike the wide-spectrum black-body white light emitted from incandescent
      bulbs.</p>

    <p>A <em>diode</em> is a two-terminal semiconductor device which only
      conducts current in one direction.  For this reason, LEDs
      are <em>polarized</em>, and will not light up if connected backward
      (<em>reverse-biased</em>).</p>

    <p>Diodes can be modeled as a non-linear resistance which changes with the
      applied voltage: when reverse-biased, the resistance is very high, and
      almost no current flows.  When forward-biased at small voltages below
      the <em>forward voltage</em>, the resistance is still high and only a
      small current flows.  Above the forward voltage, the resistance rapidly
      drops and the diode can conduct substantial current.  For LEDs, this is
      also the point at which they start to light up.</p>

    <p>However, this poses a problem, since an LED connected directly to a power
      source with a voltage higher than the forward voltage will enter a very
      low-resistance state, conduct a lot of current, and often burn out or
      melt. We will frequently solve this by using a <em>ballast resistor</em>
      in series with the LED.  This forms a voltage divider which acts as a very
      simple current regulator.</p>

    <p>A typical red LED has a forward voltage of 1.6V and a full-on operating
      current of 20&#160;mA.The calculation for choosing the right ballast resistor
      follows this reasoning:</p>

      <ol>
	<li>the current flow through the resistor and LED should be 20&#160;mA for full brightness</li>
	<li>the voltage drop across the resistor should bring the LED applied voltage to approximately the forward voltage</li>
	<li>assuming a 5V supply voltage, a 3.4V drop across resistor brings the LED voltage to 1.6V</li>
	<li>for the resistor, <span class="eqn">R = V / i, so R can be
	approximately 170&#160;ohms (i.e. <span class="eqn">3.4V /
	0.020A</span>).</span></li>
      </ol>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>

      <li>Before applying power, measure the variable resistor and adjust it to the upper end of its resistance range.
      </li><li>Apply 5V and observe the LED light output.  Reverse the polarity of
	the LED to see both forward and backward states.</li>
      <li>Measure the LED current while full-on.</li>
      <li>Slowly adjust the variable resistor (a <em>potentiometer</em>) until the LED current is 20mA.</li>
      <li>Measure the resistor value.</li>
      <li>Measure the LED voltage drop, resistor voltage drop, and supply voltage.</li>
      <li>Don't reduce the potentiometer setting further or it may be damaged.  Later you will deliberately destroy an LED to see the outcome.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>The potentiometer can be damaged by excessive current in this circuit
      when the wiper moves close to the powered end since a lot of current will
      flow through a small resistor.</p>

    <p>Green and blue LEDs usually have a higher forward voltage, sometimes as
      high as 3.5V.  Blue LEDs were invented much more recently than red LEDs, it
      took many years to find an affordable chemical composition.</p>

    <p>The lab also stocks infrared (IR) LEDs which emits invisible light; this
      is the same type used by many remote controls.</p>

    <p>For a challenge, find one of the four-terminal RGB LEDs and set up a
      circuit to create different colors.</p>
