    <h2>Exercise: Capacitance</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Understand an basic resistor-capacitor (RC) timing circuit.</p>

    <p><a href="&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitance"><em>Capacitance</em></a>
      is a fundamental property of all bodies which describes their ability to
      store electrical
      charges. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor"><em>Capacitors</em></a>
      are two-terminal electronic components engineered for specific capacitance
      properties.  Capacitors are used for a variety of purposes in circuits,
      including energy storage, power supply smoothing, signal filtering, and
      timing.</p>

    <p>Unlike resistors, the fundamental relation between voltage across a
      capacitor and the current flowing through it is described by
      a <em>differential equation</em> involving time.  For this reason,
      capacitor circuits always involve an element of temporal behavior.</p>

    <p>In this example, a resistor and a capacitor form a very simple timing
      circuit.  When the momentary switch is closed, current flows through the
      resistor and charges the capacitor.  As current stores charge in the
      capacitor, the OUT voltage rises.  As the OUT voltage rises, the voltage
      drop across the resistor is reduced and so the charging current flow is
      reduced.  This leads to a characteristic first-order exponential response
      in which the voltage climbs rapidly at first and then slows to
      asymptotically approach the source voltage, with a <em>time constant</em>
      of <span class="eqn">t = R * C</span>.  With the given values (10K Ohms
      and 100 microFarads), the time constant is 1&#160;second, so the waveform
      will easily be seen on an oscilloscope and can almost be seen on a
      DMM.</p>

    <p>Once the capacitor is charged and the switch is opened, it will hold
      charge and energy and the OUT voltage will ideally remain constant.  Any
      real-life capacitor has a finite leakage, so in practice, the voltage will
      slowly decline back toward zero.</p>

    <p>Capacitors come in both polarized and non-polarized varieties, depending
      on the type of material in use.  In general, larger capacitors
      are <em>electrolytic</em> and are polarized, as in the diagram.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>Wire the circuit, being sure to observe the capacitor polarity.  There
	are additional 100&#160;uF parts in the Assorted bin, or you can use a
	larger size if needed.</li>

      <li>Observe the OUT voltage on an oscilloscope for three conditions: while
	the momentary switch is closed, with the switch open, and while shorting
	the capacitor with a jumper wire.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>For a challenge, try adding a diode to create a
      simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_detector"><em>envelope
      detector</em></a>.</p>

    <p>Modern touch screens measure the capacitance of a human finger touching
      the surface.</p>

    <p>Very large capacitors can produce dangerously high currents and sparks
      when shorted.  Extremely large
      &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercapacitor">supercapacitors</a>&#8221;
      have been recently developed for energy storage and are used in
      regenerative braking systems on electric vehicles to capture energy.</p>

    <p>This is the barest scrape into the rich dynamic behavior possible with
      capacitor circuits. There are an endless number of analog filter and
      timing circuits using capacitors.  A related component is
      the <em>inductor</em> which also has complementary dynamic behavior
      involving asymptotic current changes.</p>
