    <h2>Exercise: Multichannel Driver</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Interface multiple motors using an integrated driver.</p>

    <p>An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">integrated
	circuit</a> (aka IC or chip) is a multi-component circuit fabricated on
	a single piece of semiconductor material.  The complexity ranges from a
	just a few transistors up to billions of components in a high-end CPU
	chip.</p>

    <p>This exercise uses
      a <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/uln2803a.pdf">ULN2803
      driver</a> which provides the equivalent of eight individual transistor
      drive circuits in a single package, enough to drive eight relays or turn
      eight motors on an off.  It is polarized, so each channel is either on or
      off and conducts only one direction.  The outputs
      are <em>open-collector</em>, which in practice means they sink a positive
      current to a common ground.</p>

    <p>Unlike the MOSFET, the bipolar transistors have a noticeable voltage drop and
      dissipate more power for the same output current.  We use these parts
      because they are inexpensive, robust, and have the convenience of multiple
      channels.</p>

    <p>Note that the inputs are engineered for 5V logic, but the outputs are
      rated to 50V, so the load can be a DC load at a substantial higher voltage
      than the logic.  Each output is rated for 500&#160;mA maximum current, but
      in practice the maximum load that can be switched is a function of the
      overall dissipation.  E.g., running too many outputs at too high a current
      may exceed the total heating limit, which is a function of the package
      type and heat-sinking.</p>

    <p>The outputs
      include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyback_diode"><em>clamp
      diodes</em></a> connected to the COM terminal which help absorb voltage
      spikes typically created when motors or relay coils turn off.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Wire up the circuit, trying to use only the schematic.  This is also a
      good opportunity to look at
      the <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/uln2803a.pdf">data sheet for
      the ULN2803</a>.</li>
      <li>Using a jumper wire, apply 5V (&#8216;HIGH&#8217;) to IN7 and IN8,
      observing the motor activity.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>The actual topology of each channel is a <em>Darlington pair</em>, a
      circuit which uses two bipolar transistors cascaded for higher gain.  The
      data sheet includes a schematic approximating the circuit for each
      channel.</p>

    <p>The logic symbol is drawn as a triangle with a circle at the output
      representing an <em>inverted</em> output which is active-low.  In
      practice, the &#8216;low&#8217; output is generally sinking power through
      the load, so it still represents the &#8216;active&#8217; state, i.e., a
      high input turns the load on.</p>

    <p>Like the MOSFET circuit, note hat the input and output circuits are not
      isolated from each other.</p>
