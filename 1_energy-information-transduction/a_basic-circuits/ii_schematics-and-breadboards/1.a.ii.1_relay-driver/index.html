    <h2>Exercise: Relay Driver</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Connect two circuits using a relay.</p>

    <p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay">relay</a> is a mechanical
      switch controlled by an electrical signal.  A current through the control
      coil creates a magnetic field which physically moves an electrical contact
      from a normally-closed (NC) contact to a normally-open (NO) contact. In
      most relays, the switch immediately returns to the normally-closed state
      when the coil is de-energized.  Relays come in many shapes, sizes, and
      configurations; this exercise uses a relatively small relay controlled by
      a 5V signal.</p>

    <p>We can look at it in several ways: as an <em>interface</em> between an
      informational signal and an energetic signal; as a
      binary <em>amplifier</em> which allows a modest control signal to control a
      high-power energetic circuit; as an <em>isolator</em> which allows the
      input circuit to affect the output circuit without sharing any
      current.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Try wiring the circuit only from the schematic rather than the
	breadboard diagram; now is the time to become used to reading schematics
	and rendering them onto the breadboard using your own judgement.</li>
      <li>Set the power supplies to the specified voltages first.  We are using
      a low-voltage motor so the 3V is actually the &#8216;high-power&#8217;
      energy supply and the 5V is the logic supply.</li>
      <li>Manually connect and disconnect the coil circuit, listening for the physical motion inside the relay and observing the different output states.</li>
      <li>Measure the coil current and resistance, and compute the power dissipated by the coil.</li>
      <li>Measure the motor current, and compute the power dissipated by the motor.</li>
      <li>Compute the power gain of the amplifier: the output power divided by the input power.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>Relays are relatively slow but very robust.  The contacts are just switch
      contacts, so they have no polarity, and many relays are suitable for
      safely switching AC line circuits.  There are other variants on relays
      such as <em>latching relays</em> in which one coil is pulsed to change
      state and another pulsed to change it back.  There are relays with many
      sets of contacts for controlling multiple output circuits from a single
      control coil.</p>

    <p>Relays are the original form of logic component; it is possible to build
      a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_I">programmable
      computer using nothing but relays</a>.  The early automatic telephone
      switches made extensive use
      of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepping_switch">elaborate
      electromechanical switches</a>.</p>

    <p>Small challenge: set up a relay circuit in which the coil current passes
      through the NC contact in series with the coil.  What do you expect will
      happen?</p>
