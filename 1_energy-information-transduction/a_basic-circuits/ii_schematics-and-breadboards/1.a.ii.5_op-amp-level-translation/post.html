<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Use an op-amp circuit to match a sensor signal output to a driver signal input.</p>

    <p>Many physical computing projects face the problem of translating an
      analog voltage from one range to another.  For example, the Sharp range
      finders put out a signal from 0 to 3.0V, but the IRF540 MOSFET turn-on
      voltage is closer to 3.5-4.0V.  An effective way to match one signal type
      to another is to add an amplifier stage which applies
      a <strong>gain</strong> and <strong>offset</strong> using a
      linear <strong>op-amp</strong>, short for
      &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifier">operational
      amplifier</a>.&#8221; An op-amp is a basic building block for many kinds
      of linear circuits, including amplifiers, filters, oscillators, mixers,
      integrators, differentiators, etc.  It can also be used to make non-linear
      circuits, such as a comparator or a Schmitt trigger.  The reference guides
      below include many sample circuits.</p>

    <p>Op-amps were originally constructed as modules of discrete components,
      but we will be using integrated circuit op-amps built on a single chip.
      The idealization of an op-amp is a differential amplifier with arbitrarily
      large gain: <span class="eqn">Vout = G * (V+ - V-)</span>, where G is
      infinite.  The ideal op-amp has zero input current and infinite output
      voltage range.  The infinite gain implies a simple heuristic, which is
      that for a negative-feedback circuit in equilibrium, the output must be at
      a voltage such that the inputs V+ and V- have equal voltage.  Otherwise,
      even a tiny difference of input voltage would lead to an infinite
      output.</p>

    <p>In practice, the op-amps we use have inputs with very high input
      impedance which draw essentially no current.  The output is limited to a
      range within the supply voltages (the &#8216;rails&#8217;).  The gain is
      quite high but not infinite.  In practical circuits, the overall gain is
      set by constructing a resistor network which defines the relationship
      between the changes in the output and the changes in the input.  If a
      large output voltage change is required at the output to maintain the
      equal-input equilibrium for a small change of input signal, then the
      signal will be amplified.</p>

    <p>This exercise explores two basic amplifier circuits, an inverting
      amplifier and a non-inverting amplifier.  Each uses four resistors to form
      two voltage dividers, one to control the gain and one for offset.  In each
      case, the voltage divider between the output and the V- terminal controls
      the gain.</p>

    <p>Many op-amp circuits are designed for a dual supply, meaning they assume
      the availability of matched positive and negative supplies centered around
      the zero ground voltage.  However, it is more convenient for our purposes
      to just use a single supply, so some care may be required when using
      cookbook circuits.</p>

    <p>We have the TL072P op-amp in stock, which includes two op-amps in an
      8-pin package.  The TL072 isn't designed for single-supply operation, so
      this part will be replaced with a 'rail-to-rail' part in a revised version
      of this exercise.  For the time being, the circuit works but is sensitive
      to the gain and offset settings, as the op-amp output needs to stay within
      a range roughly between 1.3 and 4.0 Volts.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Wire up the inverting amplifier circuit.</li>

      <li>Modulate the distance of the object nearest the sensor.  The distance
	sensor emits a higher voltage for near objects, which normally would
	turn on the LED at close range.  Due to the signal inversion, the LED
	turns off at close range.</li>

      <li>Wire up the non-inverting circuit.</li>

      <li>Modulate the distance of the object nearest the sensor.  The amplifier
	is applying gain to match the 0-3V sensor signal to the higher voltage
	required to turn on the MOSFET; adjust the gain pot until the LED turns
	on with an object at close range and off with an object at far
	range.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>If you experiment, you can find the <em>linear range</em> of the MOSFET
    in which it is neither fully on or fully off.</p>
